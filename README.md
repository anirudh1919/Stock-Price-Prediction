# Stock-Price-Prediction
Project Title:
Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Description:
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict future stock prices based on historical data and market indicators. By leveraging time series forecasting techniques and financial data, the model aims to provide accurate price predictions for stocks, helping investors make informed decisions. The project includes data collection, feature engineering, and model selection using algorithms like ARIMA, LSTM, and other regression techniques.

In addition to building the predictive model, the project also explores visualization of historical trends and real-time testing of predictions. This application is intended for educational purposes, illustrating the potential of machine learning in financial forecasting while adhering to risk considerations and limitations in real-world stock trading.
